# Startup-Accelerator-Performance-Analysis
This investigation analyzes the performance of a particular accelerator program in helping various energy startups gain traction on the market. This analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, takes into account a variety of different performance criteria when comparing startups that participated in the accelerator to ones that did not. The comparison is done over time windows that contain the periods when the startups would have been participating in the accelerator program, allowing for direct, side-by-side comparison. Two batches of startup cohorts were analyzed; they were the 2017 summer cohort and the 2018 summer cohort. From here, they were compared to startups that did not participate in the accelerator during these respective times. The single host program outlines this procedure in more detail.
